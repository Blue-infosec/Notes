### Vulnerability management
Vulnerabilities in software is a practical reality for any IT professionals/Sysadmins and you can attribute many cyberattacks to the failure of sysadmins to identify vulnerabilties in time or failing to patch the existing vulnerabilities. The latest statistics have shown that such attacks cover more than 90% cases.

In broad sense, vulnerabilities can be categorized as:
#### Known vulnerabilties
* Known to the world but unknown to sysadmin (lack of awareness)
* Known to sysadmin but failure to patch in time

#### Unknown vulnerabilties
* Vulnerabilties not yet discovered
* Vulnerabilities known to very few people(zero-day)

In many cases, public exploits for these vulnerabilities are available on the internet and malicious actors/hackers will be using them on a case-to-case basis. In case of state sponsored hackers, these exploits are specifically written for a targeted environment.

So, no matter how large or small the network that you oversee, it is critical that every organization has to have a vulnerability management program.

Vulnerability management is never ending process and you have to be continuously proactive in identifying and mitigating existing vulnerabilties as soon as they are announced.

#### Vulnerability scans
You need to do periodic vulnerability scanning of all your network devices, servers, host and any other devices on the network and list down the products and programs installed. Further, you have to ensure that this list is up-to-date as users/admin may install/un-install any products/programs in day-to-day operations.

A good vulnerability scanner(e.g. GFI LANGuard) not only maintains an up-to-date list of installed products/programs on the network but also keeps track of underlying operating system vulnerabilties(Linux, Windows).

#### Importance of patching
There are many cyberattacks that have happened due to un-patched vulnerabilties. There are many reasons like improper patch schedule,over-confident sysadmins(it may not happen to my server) and lack of awareness of the security vulnerabilty.

So, it is important to have a patching schedule as a part of your vulnerability management policy. This schedule should allow enough time to test the patches for bugs or any side-effects in staging environements and only then the patching needs to be applied to production machines. For the zero-day or critical vulnerabilties, it is important to have contigency plan so that these can be applied to production systems as soon as possible to minimize the damage.
