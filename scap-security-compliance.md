### Security Content Automation Protocol(SCAP) based security compliance

In the present world, security compliance is a MUST requirement in many industries like finance, health, pharma etc and now, it has become a legal requirement in many cases. Regulatory standards like PCI-DSS, BITS, HIPPA and ISO27001 prescribe security recommendations for protecting data and improving information security management in the organization. By fulfiling the requirements of security compliance, you are able to mitigate many network and/or web application security attacks and are able to achieve specific IT security goals for an organization to protect its reputation.

On one hand, organizations are confronted increasing audit and security compliance obligations with increased privacy concerns, while on the other hand, the use of cloud services, mobile ubiquity, BYOD and other mechanisms have made achieving security compliance more complex. Further, each security standard involves evolving set of specific requirements, achieving security compliance has become complicated and a costly affair. In order to gain protection from liabilities in case of a security breach, organizations are spending large amount of time and money on regulatory compliance efforts. 

Improving security posture is never easy journey and there will be many hurdles in implementation; but with common security terminology and standardized tools like SCAP, it's achievable.

Security content automation protocol(SCAP) allows guidance documents like CIS benchmarks to be expressed in open and machine readable form. SCAP validation allows user to draw conclusions about their organization's security posture in a complex environment. SCAP allows machine processing of raw security data - e.g. naming of security flaws, test for presence of flaws, status of configuration option. This provides the potential for dramatically better, more automated security posture determination for the organization. The same assessment would take much more time if done in a manual way.

Typically, SCAP based validation is done in the following way:
* Scan the system against open cybersecurity standards
* Calculate the score to evaluate security posture
* Interoperate with other SCAP validated scanners to present results in standard way

SCAP community discussions are based on deep analysis of technology and field testing of operational systems. Combined with threat information from security community and SCAP guidance present best translation of vulnerability knowledge into the language of system administrators.e.g. CIS benchmarks translates threat knowledge into system configuration that will prevent spread of many attack vector.

In spite of this,many organizations find it difficult to maintain compliance due to lack of resource and expertize.
But, it is necessary to go for achieving compliance as it will result in:
* Reduce cyber risk by following best practice guides and expedite overall compliance process
* Fulfiling of information security reporting and auditing requirements
