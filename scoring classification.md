## ML Scoring classification

* Ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to total predicted positive observations
precision = TP/ (TP+FP)

* Recall is ratio of correcly predicted positive observations to all observations in actual class.
Recall = TP/ (TP+ FN)

* F1 score = weighted average of precision and recall. this takes in account both false positives and false negatives.
F1 = 2* ( recall * precision) / (recall + precision)
